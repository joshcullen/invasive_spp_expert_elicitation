### For a list of invasive and potentially invasive species. We willâ€¦

1. Derive a composite estimate (across participants) of habitat suitability
2. Derive a composite estimate of species relative prevalence across the landscape
3. Derive estimates of detectability
4. Compile and/or verify a list of ecologically relevant traits for modeling
5. Assess current data availability (e.g., location and survey data) for calibration and validation of models
6. Discuss ongoing and possible management options for scenario-based modeling
7. Identify future products and collaborative outputs for workshop participants
