      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nThis expert elicitation workshop will seek knowledge from a range of experts on the expected habitat suitability and geographic range of occupancy for up to 20 invasive species throughout the southeastern US. Responses will be aggregated among participants to create weighted composites of expected species occurrence at present and into the future. This workshop is supported by ABC funding sources and is hosted by XYZ people and organizations.\nInvited participants will provide their insight on invasive species habitat suitability and occupancy through an interactive web application created with R Shiny.\n\n\n\n",
