      "contents": "\nThe purpose of this workshop is to elicit expert knowledge on the current geographic range, habitat suitability, and ecological traits of established invasive species. Data will be collated across participants to derive estimates of current distribution as well as project future range shifts or expansions over time.\nFood\nLunch will be provided. Coffee and snack will be available throughout the day.\nPrior to attendance\nParticipants are asked to complete a trial of the Shiny app to familiarize themselves with the process before attending the workshop (for 3 spp.). Please complete your three species by April 21st.\nWhat to bring\nLaptop or tablet\nYour thoughtful contributions\nQuestions\nFor any further information regarding this workshop and how these results will be used, please contact Brett Scheffers at brett.scheffers@ufl.edu\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis expert elicitation workshop aims to use expert elicitation to assess invasive species risk throughout the southeastern US. We have developed a purpose built web application that will be used to collate expert knowledge to produce models of current species distributions and future distributions under climate change. The workshop would focus on approximately 10-15 invasive species that are currently, or have the potential to be, highly detrimental to ecosystems of the SE US. These species come from our initial meeting over Zoom in Autumn 2021 where we ranked species. Thus, this first workshop is quite focused on taxonomic expertise in distribution and ecological/trait data. We will then have a second workshop where we explore management options in light of outputs from workshop 1.\nThis workshop is supported by the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and is hosted by the University of Florida. The workshop leads are:\nBrett Scheffers, Assistant Professor\nLuke Evans, Post-doc\nAlex Baecher, PhD candidate\nJosh Cullen, Post-doc\nInvited participants will provide their insight on invasive species habitat suitability and prevalence through an interactive web application created with R Shiny. This web app can be accessed from the ‘App’ tab at the top of the page or through the link to shinyapps.io.\n\n\n\n",
